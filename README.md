# We The People WordPress Plugin

**National Day of Civic Hacking - June 1, 2013**

This is my presentation for the National Day of Civic Hacking at the White House on the [We The People WordPress plugin](https://github.com/buckii/we-the-people-wordpress) developed by [Buckeye Interactive](http://www.buckeyeinteractive.com). The deck was put together using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

On June 1 the plugin will become available through the WordPress.org repositories at [http://wordpress.org/plugins/we-the-people](http://wordpress.org/plugins/we-the-people/).
